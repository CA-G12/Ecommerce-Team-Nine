* I want to able to search for item on the store by the name 
* I want to able to filter items by the price or by category
* I want to add item to my Cart
* I want to be able to see the items inside my cart
* I want to be able to delete any items inside my cart
* I want to be able to see the total price of the items inside my cart
* I want to be able to disply the items either as a grid or a list
 
2. Seller
* I want to be able to add my product (name, detail, price, image[link], and category)
  * Should have the category as a list of options (dropdown menu)
* I want to be able to see all of my product
* I want to be able to search through my products
* I want to be able to delete my own product
* I want to be able to edit all the information of my product
